# Comparison of regridding packages used for climate/weather data

## Overview

Regridding, that is the process of mapping fields from a source grid to another destination grid with different resolution,
is widely used in pre- and post-processing tools. Here we provide a comparison of regridding tools in terms of:

 * Accuracy
 * Numerical Performance
 * And their ability to handle masking (invalid data)

 We will use 2D structured grids for input data and typically uniform latitude/longitude grids as target grids. 

The regridding tools we considered are:

 * Iris built-in regridding
 * libcf 1.6.9
 * sigrid
 * ESMF 7.x

 The considered interpolation methods are bilinear and conservative. Bilinear is suitable for nodal 
 data whereas conservative should be applied to cell centred data, for which there is a need to 
 conserve global quantities sucha as mass, energy, etc. None of these methods are appropriate for 
 vector fields such as the velocity on a Arakawa C grid for which the components are staggered.

 The capabilities of the regridding tools are summarized below:

|               |  grid type    |   bilinear?   | conservative? |  store weights? |
|---------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
|  iris         |  uniform     |    yes       |     yes        |     no          | 
|  libcf        |  structured  |    yes        |    no         |     yes         |  
| sigrid        |  structured  |    no         |    yes        |     yes         |
| ESMF          |  structured  |    yes        |    yes        |     yes         |

Note that some tools have capabilities we have not tested. For instance, libcf supports linear 
interpolation in n-dimensions while ESMF supports interpolation from and onto unstructured grids in 
2D and 3D. 

## Accuracy

### Bilinear

Simple sinusoidal field on a uniform source grid with invalid data inside a quarter of a disk. Shown are 
the source field values on nodes and the interpolated fields values on the much finer destination grid.
Notice that destination points falling inside source cells that have an invalid node are not interpolated. In 
the case of libcf, on the other hand, the destination points will be interpolated provided they fall within 
a valid triangle subcell.

### Conservative

## Performance

### Uniform to uniform grid

### Rotated pole to uniform grid

### Tripolar grid to uniform grid
